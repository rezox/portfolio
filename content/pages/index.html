I'm Steven Lu, I'm a developer that focuses on web development, mobile applications, and user interface design. I'm also well rounded in system administration and development. I love web and I want to make it a more useful and productive space.

I recently graduated with a degree in Electrical and Computer Engineering from Rutgers University and currently work at a startup named <a href="https://urbancompass.com" target="_new">Urban Compass</a>.

Feel free to browse my work or find out who I am, I try to update this as new things come up. I'm always up to chat so feel free to get in contact with me.
