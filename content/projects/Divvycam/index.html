Divvycam targets iOS devices and makes it easier to share photos between devices. 

The application was developed using Titanium which heavily relied on Javascript code. Some key concepts of the code include photo compression, in-app purchase interactions, and API requests. An API was also built with a custom load-balancer and web-node solution on the Amazon Web Services platform. Essentially, servers would spin up and down according to load percentages.
