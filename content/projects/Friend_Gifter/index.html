Friend Gifter is an application which helps you find gifts your friends that have upcoming birthdays. We know you don't know all of your Facebook friends so we do the hard part for you. You first login to the application using your Facebook account and then we search your friends that have birthdays coming up. When you select a friend, we then look up the interests and likes of that friend and compute which products and gifts are approrpiate for them using Google Shopping API.

This application features a fully response design and is built using static files.

This application was fully developed by myself with help from Kenneth Jaffe with some graphical aspects. This project won "Best use of Heroku" and "Best Overall Application" during Facebook's World Hack in Austin, TX 2012.
