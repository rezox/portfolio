NextBeezy is an application built on top of the NextBus service. Most of the time you're on a routine and the only things you want to see is the Routes and Stops that you need. 

Built for iOS using the Titanium SDK. With help from Wayne Sun and Jason Caetano. And much thanks to Juan Barzuto, Phil Femano, and Catherine Yu.

You can use and duplicate the NextBus backend code at:
