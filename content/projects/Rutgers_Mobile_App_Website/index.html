The Rutgers Mobile App website is targeted to inform users about the official Rutgers Mobile App. 

The design follows Rutgers' Visual Identity manual and conforms to the design requirements issued by Rutgers.

The site uses CSS media queries to automatically display different CSS elements when the browser is either resized or is viewed on a mobile device. There is absolutely no forwarding required and no unnecessary data loaded when loaded on a mobile device.

This site also uses jQuery for the visual aspects such as the iPhone screenshots and the "tabs" for the website itself.

Developed under direction of Aaron Richton of Rutgers CSS.
