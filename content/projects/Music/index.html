Music allowed users to express themselves by placing music onto their profile page, imitating similar functionality to MySpace. This application was built in 2008 and was one of the first one hundred applications to utilize the third-party Facebook API. It was also one of the first applications to help implement social media based advertising.

Over time, the application became one of most popular applications for Indie music, where artists were able to sample their songs on their profile page.

This application gained over 8 million users, where half a million active per month. Throughout one year, there were over 500 million song plays (played for at least 30 seconds) and hit an average of 40 requests per second. 

However, because of Facebook's changes to their appearance and functionality, the Music app lost its main functionality to host Music for artists and individuals. Therefore, it was forced to be shut down and later on become open source.
