An application developed in May 2008 where Facebook users were able to upload their own Music to their profile, allowing them to express their Musical side fully. Due to the changes of Facebook, Music has changed its direction to a cloud-based service along with allowing artists to share their content on Facebook Pages. This application has over two million users, a quarter of them active in a month. 

Due to some recent Facebook API changes in 2012 and the deprecation of FBML, the Music App had to be shutdown. However, Music's source code is now open source and can be found on GitHub.
