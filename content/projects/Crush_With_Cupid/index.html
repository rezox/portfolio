Crush With Cupid is a Facebook integrated application that allows friends to select who they have a crush on. If a crush is mutually found between the two, they are immediately contacted about each other with a special deal from LivingSocial or Groupon. If there is no match, the two remain completely anonymous. 

At a technical standpoint, this was built in PHP and Javascript and many engineering problems. Since this was built on Heroku, it was built in mind for low CPU and low memory usage, where most calculations were off-loaded to the client Javascript. We also alleviated load time by directly accessing the Facebook FQL tables and performing RESTful AJAX calls to our backend. By doing so, we saved load times from 3 seconds to about 0.7 seconds. All visual filtering and searching is also done on client-side Javascript, making it snappy and response and to reduce the amount of times photos were loaded into the browser.

Crush With Cupid is fully responsive and can be viewed perfectly on high-dpi or Retina displays. Built with <a href="http://lizjamora.com" target="_new">Liz Jamora</a> and Zach Myrow.
