Bar Hop gives people the ability to find out a list of bars to hop to. It finds the first bar by determining an appropriate girl to guy ratio that must be one to one. After, it checks what common places are checked into afterwards from that bar. It does this process from Foursquare until it finds a list of 3-4 bars for you.

Bar Hop is completely mobile web and is best used when installed to the home screen.
