My friends, Jarek Sedlacek, Wayne Sun and Russell Frank, and I developed this application during HackNY, a 24 hour hackathon in October 2011. The objective of the hackaton was to create a product wrapped around one or more APIs presented at the hackaton. 50% was graded in the idea and 50% was graded on deliverable. We built the application using Node.js, Express.js, Jade, Stylus, MongoDB and of course jQuery.
