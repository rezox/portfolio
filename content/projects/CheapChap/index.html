An application built for HackNY Fall 2011, built in 24 hours during October 1-2, 2011. 

CheapChap allows users to budget how they go out, "Love ain't cheap, but your date can be!"

By using APIs from Yelp, HyperPublic, Etsy, bit.ly, and Google Maps, we're able to give you some cheap suggestions based on your location.

The backend was built using Node.js, Express, Jade, Stylus and MongoDB. Frontend was built using jQuery and the jQuery UI.

The cool thing about CheapChap is how quick and fluid it is. Instead of pulling the APIs all the time (which may take several seconds), we use MongoDB to cache choices every so often so it looks snappy to the user.

Frontend was designed and developed by myself (Steven Lu) and Wayne Sun. Backend by Jarek Sedlacek and Russell Frank with modifications by Steven Lu.
