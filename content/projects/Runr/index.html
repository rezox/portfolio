Runr has the intention of solving the "traveling salesman" problem. This problem entails not knowing your surroundings and the order you want to complete your tasks. With Runr, we find places to complete your tasks and we try to find the shortest path possible to complete these tasks in.

Runr has three aspects -- the front-end UI/UX, entity extraction, and lastly the shortest path algorithm. More details can be found and is open source on <a href="https://github.com/sjlu/runr" target="_new">github</a>.

This application was developed with Wayne Sun who worked on graphics and design and Russell Frank who engineered the shortest path algorithm. My role included UI/UX development and the entity extraction of the application.

Runr was developed during Facebook's Summer of Hack competition in Facebook NY.
