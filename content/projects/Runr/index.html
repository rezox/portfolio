Runr has the intention of solving the "traveling salesman" problem. This problem entails not knowing your surroundings and the order you want to complete your tasks. With Runr, we find places to complete your tasks and we try to find the shortest path possible to complete these tasks in.

Runr has three aspects -- the front-end UI/UX, entity extraction, and lastly the shortest path algorithm. Developed with Wayne Sun and Russell Frank during Facebook's Summer of Hack 2012 in NYC.
