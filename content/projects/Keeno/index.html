Keeno is a application which supports spontaneous social messaging by relating your commonalities through Facebook. 

Keeno was developed during HackRU in Spring of 2011. This has not been published in the App Store due to lack of interest in the project. If you'd like the IPA file or a video on the UI design, please feel free to contact me.
