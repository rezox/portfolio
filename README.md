Purpose
=======

Well, I constantly rewrote my portfolio website all the time and I got tired of doing so. Instead, I decided to go to other websites that actually have a CMS to control it all, services like Cargo Collective and and Carbon Made. But then, they either had all these limitations and you have to pay to get these limitations removed.

So instead I decided to create my own, as a open source project. The gerat thing about it is that it has no administrator interface, you interact directly with it using a file and folder system and the system automatically generates pages based on the content you place in.
